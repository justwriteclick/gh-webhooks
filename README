# Create webhooks with GitHub API

This code example takes in a file with a list of GitHub repositories and uses a `configvar.py` file containing the required credentials, org, and so on, to either list or create webhooks in each repo.

## Config file
```
gh_username = "username"
gh_api_key = "9d1f1dcf---c58b5032a" # Create from Settings > Profile > Developer settings > Personal access token, scope should be admin:repo_hook
gh_orgname = "organizationname"
gh_secret = "d954a2----dde787" # This value is inserted in the payload for creating a webhook that requires a secret
```

## File containing list of repositories

Create a text file with one repo name per line, and be sure not to add an extra new line at the end of the file. If you have an extra new line, the script will return with "Not Found" for the last "repo name" in the file.

## Usage

Once you have your config file and List of repositories in a text file, you can run the script like so:

```
python create_webhook.py repolist.txt
```
